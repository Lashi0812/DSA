# You are given two binary trees root1 and root2. 
# 
#  Imagine that when you put one of them to cover the other, some nodes of the 
# two trees are overlapped while the others are not. You need to merge the two 
# trees into a new binary tree. The merge rule is that if two nodes overlap, then sum 
# node values up as the new value of the merged node. Otherwise, the NOT null 
# node will be used as the node of the new tree. 
# 
#  Return the merged tree. 
# 
#  Note: The merging process must start from the root nodes of both trees. 
# 
#  
#  Example 1: 
#  
#  
# Input: root1 = [1,3,2,5], root2 = [2,1,3,null,4,null,7]
# Output: [3,4,5,5,4,null,7]
#  
# 
#  Example 2: 
# 
#  
# Input: root1 = [1], root2 = [1,2]
# Output: [2,2]
#  
# 
#  
#  Constraints: 
# 
#  
#  The number of nodes in both trees is in the range [0, 2000]. 
#  -10‚Å¥ <= Node.val <= 10‚Å¥
