# Given the root of a binary tree, construct a string consisting of parenthesis 
# and integers from a binary tree with the preorder traversal way, and return it. 
# 
# 
#  Omit all the empty parenthesis pairs that do not affect the one-to-one 
# mapping relationship between the string and the original binary tree. 
# 
#  
#  Example 1: 
#  
#  
# Input: root = [1,2,3,4]
# Output: "1(2(4))(3)"
# Explanation: Originally, it needs to be "1(2(4)())(3()())", but you need to 
# omit all the unnecessary empty parenthesis pairs. And it will be "1(2(4))(3)"
#  
# 
#  Example 2: 
#  
#  
# Input: root = [1,2,3,null,4]
# Output: "1(2()(4))(3)"
# Explanation: Almost the same as the first example, except we cannot omit the 
# first parenthesis pair to break the one-to-one mapping relationship between the 
# input and the output.
#  
# 
#  
#  Constraints: 
# 
#  
#  The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 10‚Å¥]. 
#  -1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
