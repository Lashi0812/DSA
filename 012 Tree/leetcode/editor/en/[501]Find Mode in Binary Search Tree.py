# Given the root of a binary search tree (BST) with duplicates, return all the 
# mode(s) (i.e., the most frequently occurred element) in it. 
# 
#  If the tree has more than one mode, return them in any order. 
# 
#  Assume a BST is defined as follows: 
# 
#  
#  The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than or equal 
# to the node's key. 
#  The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than or 
# equal to the node's key. 
#  Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees. 
#  
# 
#  
#  Example 1: 
#  
#  
# Input: root = [1,null,2,2]
# Output: [2]
#  
# 
#  Example 2: 
# 
#  
# Input: root = [0]
# Output: [0]
#  
# 
#  
#  Constraints: 
# 
#  
#  The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 10‚Å¥]. 
#  -10‚Åµ <= Node.val <= 10‚Åµ 
#  
# 
#  
# Follow up: Could you do that without using any extra space? (Assume that the 
# implicit stack space incurred due to recursion does not count).
