# Testcase Example:  '[-1,0,1,2,-1,-4]'
#
# Given an integer array nums, return all the triplets [nums[i], nums[j],
# nums[k]] such that i != j, i != k, and j != k, and nums[i] + nums[j] +
# nums[k] == 0.
# 
# Notice that the solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: nums = [-1,0,1,2,-1,-4]
# Output: [[-1,-1,2],[-1,0,1]]
# Explanation: 
# nums[0] + nums[1] + nums[2] = (-1) + 0 + 1 = 0.
# nums[1] + nums[2] + nums[4] = 0 + 1 + (-1) = 0.
# nums[0] + nums[3] + nums[4] = (-1) + 2 + (-1) = 0.
# The distinct triplets are [-1,0,1] and [-1,-1,2].
# Notice that the order of the output and the order of the triplets does not
# matter.
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: nums = [0,1,1]
# Output: []
# Explanation: The only possible triplet does not sum up to 0.
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# Input: nums = [0,0,0]
# Output: [[0,0,0]]
# Explanation: The only possible triplet sums up to 0.
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 3 <= nums.length <= 3000
# -10^5 <= nums[i] <= 10^5
