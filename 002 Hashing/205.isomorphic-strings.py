#
# Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.
# 
# Two strings s and t are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to
# get t.
# 
# All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while
# preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same
# character, but a character may map to itself.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# Input: s = "egg", t = "add"
# Output: true
# Example 2:
# Input: s = "foo", t = "bar"
# Output: false
# Example 3:
# Input: s = "paper", t = "title"
# Output: true
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 1 <= s.length <= 5 * 10^4
# t.length == s.length
# s and t consist of any valid ascii character.
#
